# Contributing to WikimediaIranUG Website

Welcome to WikimediaIranUG Website. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Commit Convention

We are using commitizen as described above.
In more detail, it follows the [AngularJS's commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#type). You will add what kind of commit belongs to using the commitizen, and the types are as follows.

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
